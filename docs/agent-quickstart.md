# Agent quickstart
## Start with Your Own AI Assistant

Agents are powerful assistants that can be equipped with various Tools, each designed to target different goals and address specific challenges. By leveraging an AI workforce, we can achieve what was previously unimaginable.

> AI Agents are the foundation of your future AI workforce. You will build and deploy this AI workforce within SimplAI.
> 

Experience and feedback have shown that the best Agents are created by domain experts. These experts have the knowledge to design Tools tailored to their companies’ specific needs, making Agents equipped with custom Tools more successful in addressing unique challenges.

## Creating an Agent

Creating an Agent is a straightforward process that takes only a few minutes.

On the Agent page, click on the ”+ Create Agent” button at the top right. This will prompt you to a page to build your Agent from scratch

## Instruct Your Agent

Each Agent has a resume that outlines their skills and experience. For best results, it’s crucial to carefully consider what you want from an Agent and include precise instructions during the configuration phase.

> - The more detailed you are in the Agent's configuration step, the closer the Agent’s behavior will be to the desired outcome.
> 

> Test your Agent and refine the configuration to better align with your goals.

## Equip with Tools

Domain experts create the best Agents because they can design Tools tailored to their company's specific needs. Agents equipped with custom Tools are more successful in tackling company-specific challenges.

Tools allow Agents to interact with other systems, perform actions, retrieve information, and more. In SimplAI, Tools are the skills you equip your Agents with. This is beneficial for two reasons:

1. Agents are not limited by the platform's available functionality; you can expand any functionality you desire.
2. The best Agents have Tools created by domain experts for specific use cases.

> Businesses operate differently, and like onboarding a new employee, you want to onboard your Agents with your specific methods and Tools.

## Working with the Agent

Working with Agents on SimplAI uses advanced AI and tailored Tools to streamline tasks and boost productivity, ensuring effective and ethical operation.

### LLM Model

SimplAI utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of Agents. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text, making your interactions with Agents more natural and efficient.

### Base Instruction

Base instructions are the fundamental guidelines provided to an Agent, forming the core of its behavior and capabilities. These instructions define the Agent's role, responsibilities, and the general framework it operates within. Crafting precise base instructions is crucial to ensure the Agent performs tasks effectively.

1. **Define the Agent's Role**: Clearly outline the primary function of the Agent.
2. **Set Responsibilities**: Specify the tasks and duties the Agent is expected to perform.
3. **Framework and Guidelines**: Establish the rules and boundaries within which the Agent operates.

### Tools

Tools are specialized functions that enhance an Agent's abilities, allowing it to perform specific tasks, retrieve information, and interact with other systems. In SimplAI, Tools are the skills you equip your Agents with to tackle various challenges.

### Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a repository of information and processed data that an Agent can access to perform its tasks. It includes company-specific data, industry information, and other relevant content. Ensuring your Agent has access to an up-to-date and comprehensive knowledge base is essential for optimal performance.

1. **Company Data**: Internal documents, processes, and guidelines.
2. **Industry Information**: Relevant market trends, research, and statistics.
3. **Task-Specific Data**: Information pertinent to the Agent's specific tasks and functions.

### Guardrails Config

Guardrails are safety measures and constraints set to ensure that Agents operate within defined boundaries and ethical guidelines. They help prevent errors, ensure compliance, and maintain the integrity of the system.

- **Ethical Constraints**: Ensure the Agent operates within ethical boundaries.
- **Operational Limits**: Define what the Agent can and cannot do.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
