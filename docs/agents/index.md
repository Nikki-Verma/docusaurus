## Agents

SimplAI allows you to develop intelligent agents capable of automating tasks, responding to queries, and enhancing productivity. 

### What are Agents?

Agents in SimplAI are autonomous entities designed to perform specific tasks or answer queries based on the data and knowledge bases they are connected to. They can automate repetitive tasks, provide intelligent responses, and support various business functions and tools efficiently.

<!-- ### Getting Started with Agents

Here are a few methods to begin building your own agents: -->

### AI Agent Capabilities

1. **Scales to Meet Demand**
Agents can be scaled up or down to meet varying demand levels. Many of our clients experience seasonal demand fluctuations, with some periods or regions requiring more support than others (e.g., education, hospitality, and finance industries).
2. **Increases Engagement**
Agents can automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks, freeing up your human employees to engage in more meaningful work. For example, our sales clients appreciate that agents handle lead qualification, allowing their teams to focus more on customer meetings and closing deals.
3. **Learns from Experience**
If an agent encounters a question it cannot answer, it can loop in a sales representative or manager via your preferred communication tool (email, instant chat, etc.) and store the response for future reference. For instance, our “I don’t know” escalations are sent to a Slack channel where anyone on the team can provide an answer. The agent will then rephrase and respond to the customer, and you can also add this information to an FAQ knowledge base if desired.
4. **Can Work Autonomously or on Co-Pilot**
Agents on our platform can complete tasks end-to-end without requiring your intervention. For example, we have an agent that checks for new public tools released on our platform every weekday at 9 am, creates explainer webpages, and uploads them to Webflow—all autonomously. The best use cases for autopilot agents are low-risk tasks where minimal consequences arise if something goes wrong.
5. **Adaptive and Non-Deterministic**
Unlike traditional software solutions that respond in a fixed manner, agents have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate response for each situation. For example, a customer support agent might assist with a billing issue one day and troubleshoot a technical bug the next.

By leveraging SimplAI agents, you can enhance efficiency, engagement, and adaptability within your workforce, allowing your team to focus on higher-value activities and improve overall productivity.
